> Requires C++17. Targets GCC, Clang, MSVC.

Two variable templates define null-terminated char arrays for `type` and '`auto`' names:

```C++
  ltl::type_name_pp<T>; // 'Pretty print' name for type T.
  ltl::auto_name_pp<v>; // 'Pretty print' output for auto/NTTP value v.
```

Optionally, one or two extra integer template arguments specify a subrange [B,E):

```C++
  ltl::type_name_pp<T,B,E>; // Subarray [B,E) of type_name_pp<T>.
  ltl::type_name_pp<T,B>;   // Subarray [B,end), removes a prefix.
```

The [B,E) range indices are signed integers:  

>* Positive values index forward from begin index 0 as usual.
>* Negative values index backward from the end of the char array  
(-1 serves as end index here as all arrays are zero-terminated).

For convenience, `_pu` versions return the string that follows any final "`::`" separator:
```C++
  ltl::type_name_pu<T>; // type name with leading qualifiers stripped.
  ltl::auto_name_pu<v>; // auto name with leading qualifiers stripped.
```

## Usage examples

```C++
  namespace Hello { struct World; }
  puts( ltl::type_name_pp<Hello::World> );
```

Outputs "`Hello::World`"

Use `decltype(expr)` to query the type of an expression such as a variable:

```C++
  const char abc[1][2][3]{};
  std::cout << type_name_pp<decltype(abc)>;
```

Outputs `char const [1][2][3]` or `const char[1][2][3]` (or something similar)
